    content: >- 
      I'm a passionate Moroccan developer living in Casablanca, with more than 8 years experience as IT Consultant.

      In a changing world, digital transformation brought its challenges and added values which led to IT moving from a platform of support to a business leverage.

      Agile / Scrum methodology is my way-to-go when it comes to my digital transformation consultancy with strong technical value.

      My daily work is to set up new IT systems that can resolve daily IT problems using my skill set:
      - Java
      - Cloud computing & DevOps
      - Software Architect
      - Software Craftsmanship
